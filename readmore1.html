    <h1>WEIGHT LIFTING</h1>
    <img src="1.jpg" align="center">
    
    <h3>  Out of every person who lives in this world there are a selected few who decide to lift weights or 
        work out. Everyone who works out has there reasons. The majority of the population would most likely 
        reply to such a question with the answer "Because I want to be big".<br> That is also usually what the 
        non weight lifters believe is the only reason people would choose to work out. To most people that's 
        all there is to it, but in reality there is much more to this activity than being "jacked".<br>
        One small reason to pursue weight lifting is because it's an activity that keeps you occupied and off
         the streets. People who have free time on there hands can sometimes wander off to the wrong people.
          They get into bad habits and sometimes wind up in jail where they are sent to be disciplined and 
          rehabilitated. The most popular thing to do in jail is weight lift. It kills time and ironically
         time is the only thing people in prison have. It is not going to hurt your body. It's possible to 
         work out anywhere at almost any time. Working out is a great way to spend unused time and it's a 
         great way to get your body going.<br>
        Another helpful reason to weight lift is that it relieve's stress. There is no possible way to believe
         that a person had no stress in there life. Everybody has a time in there life when they are so 
         aggravated that they just need to hit something or yell at someone. Instead of throwing a rampage
          and damaging something or someone, instead you can just simply work out. What ever you use to work 
          out with will never yell back or fight back, no matter how aggressive you might treat it. Weather its 
          pushups or an extreme professional body building exorcize, it helps.
        The best reason to lift weights is the fact that it keeps your body healthy and fit. </h3>
